# Network of Thrones

A [node-link diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing) of Game of Thrones interactions created as an example of using [SAND](https://github.com/testedminds/sand) to analyze social networks.

## Getting Started

Run `jupyter notebook` to run the network analysis, visualize in Cytoscape, and export data and style in Cytoscape format.

Run `make dev` to build a Docker container to run the JavaScript version of the visualization as a static site served by
an nginx container.
